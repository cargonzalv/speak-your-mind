    Really good example of how to use Reactjs.
    

Tecnhologies Used:

  Backend:
    Main: NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB.
    others: body-parser, cors, crypto, express-jwt, fs, jsonwebtoken.
    
  Frontend:
    ReactJS.
   
  To run it locally:
  
    'npm install' installs backend dependencies.
  
    'npm run dev' to run the backend if you have pm2 installed, 'npm start' otherwise.
  
    'cd front' moves to directory 'front'
  
    'npm install' installs frontend dependencies.
  
    'npm start' to start a development Reactjs server.
   
    'npm build' to build an optimized static frontend, which will be served by the backend.
